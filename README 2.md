# CPL-Final-Project_bonus part

The description of the program:

Our project is created to encrypt and decrypt string that user enter, We use one of the RSA Algorithm in Cryptography

Firstly in main function : • we view a menu of choices to (Encrypt, Decrypt, or Exit the user will do operations number of times he wants on different words until he chooses Exit

IF the user chooses "Encrypt": • The program will ask him to enter the word "message" he wants to encrypt. • Calling function "Encryption" will start, and passing ("the message ", and "the number of iterations of the loop ")

we make functions :

prime function :to check prime and return 0 or 1 

create_decrytion_key function : to do the opearation to make decrytion_key array we use in 
          ecryption function : to make private and public key ( encryption and decryption key ) we use in 
                                encrypt function : that make encryption process and print the string ecrypted 
                                decrypt function : that make decryption process and print the string derypted 

then in main : 

            IF the user chooses "Encrypt": 
• The program will ask him to enter the word "msg" he wants to encrypt. • Calling function "Encrypt" will start, and passing ("the message ")

            IF the user chooses "Decrypt":
• The program will ask him to enter the word "msg" he wants to decrypt • Calling function "Decrypt" will start, and passing ("the message ")


Finaly : If the user chooses "Exit"

      the program will go out from the loop and exit the program
